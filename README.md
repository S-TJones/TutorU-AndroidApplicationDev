 Application for the course SWEN3001 - Android Application Development.

App Idea: A study/reminder app for Chinese vocabulary you learn weekly.
E.g. If you learn ten words/characters this week, add them to your vocabulary list along with the meaning and perhaps it's usage in a few sentences. 
It will remind you daily (probably set a time, or every 2 days based on settings) and it will generate a quiz of... let's say 4 characters and you pick the right one based on a random selection from the vocabulary list.
It could also track your progress and just display it in a line graph.

So far, early Mockups include:
